# Advent of Code

Each directory contains all solutions and inputs for a given problem, for example:

```
01_sonar_sweep/
|__example.txt
|__input.txt
|__part1.{rb,go}
|__part2.{rb,go}
|__README.md
```

- `example.txt` contains the example input in the problem description.
- `input.txt` contains the problem input for the final solution.
- `part1.<ext>` is the solution to part1 in either Ruby (`*.rb`) or Go (`*.go`)
- `part2.<ext>` is the solution to part2 in either Ruby (`*.rb`) or Go (`*.go`)
- `README.md` contains the problem description for both parts
